========

Fabric is a simple, pythonic tool for remote deployment. It provides a bunch of libraries and a command-line tool for streamlining the use of SSH for application deployment or systems administration tasks. If you are not familiar with python and fabric, do not worry. Here's a wrapper for fabric which is written in pure Java. It just takes a few configurational info and generates a python (fabric) source code for you which is ready to be executed right away!
